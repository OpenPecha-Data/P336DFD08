their minds,

282. ’Surely they ought to consider old age, disease, and death, and day and night stir themselves
up to exertion, whilst this sharp double-edged sword hangs over the neck. What room
for sport or laughter,

283. ’Beholding those (monsters) old age, disease, and death? A man who is unable to resort
to this inward knowledge, what is he but a wooden or a plaster man, what heart-consideration
in such a case!
