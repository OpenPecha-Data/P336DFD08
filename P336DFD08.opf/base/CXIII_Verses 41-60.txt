the angry thunder-drops and mighty hail, with these, were changed into five-colour’d lotus flowers,1083.
Whilst the foul poison of the dragon snakes was turned to spicy-breathing air.

Thus all these countless sorts of creatures, wishing to destroy the Bodhisattva,1084. Unable
to remove him from the spot, were with their own weapons wounded.

Now Mâra had an aunt-attendant whose name was Ma-kia-ka-li (Mâha Kâlî?),1085. Who held a skull-dish
in her hands, and stood in front of Bodhisattva, and with every kind of winsome gesture,
tempted to lust the Bodhisattva.

1086. So all these followers of Mâra, possessed of every demon-body form, united in discordant
uproar, hoping to terrify Bodhisattva;1087. But not a hair of his was moved, and Mâra’s
host was filled with sorrow.

Then in the air the crowd of angels (spirits), their forms invisible, raised their voices, saying:1088.
’Behold the great Muni; his mind unmoved by any feeling of resentment, whilst
all that wicked Mâra race, besotted, are vainly bent on his destruction;

1089. ’Let go your foul and murderous thoughts against that silent Muni, calmly seated! You
cannot with a breath move the Sumeru mountain;

1090. ’Fire may freeze, water may burn, the roughened earth may grow soft and pliant, but ye
cannot hurt the Bodhisattva! Thro’ ages past disciplined by suffering,

1091. Bodhisattva rightly trained in thought, ever advancing in the use of "means," pure and
illustrious for wisdom, loving and merciful to all,1092. ’These four conspicuous (excellent)
virtues cannot with him be rent asunder, so as to make it hard or doubtful whether he
gain the highest wisdom.1093. ’For as the thousand rays of yonder sun must drown the darkness
of the world,

or as the boring wood must kindle fire, or as the earth deep-dug gives water,1094. ’So he who
perseveres in the "right means," by seeking thus, will find.
