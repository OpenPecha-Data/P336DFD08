exerting himself but without exciting haste, his breath concealed and without snorting;411.
Four spirits (Devas) accompanying him, held up his feet, heedfully concealing (his advance),
silently and without noise; the heavy gates fastened and barred (locked), the heavenly
spirits of themselves caused to open;

412. Reverencing deeply the virtuous (sinless) father, loving deeply the unequalled son, equally
affected with love towards all the members of his family (these. Devas took their place).413.
Suppressing his feelings, but not extinguishing his memory,

lightly he advanced and proceeded beyond the city, pure and spotless as the lily flowers which
spring from the mud;414. Looking up with earnestness at his father’s palace, he announced
his purpose--unwitnessed and unwritten--’If I escape not birth, old age, and death, for
evermore I pass not thus along;’

415. All the concourse of Devas, the space-filling Nâgas and spirits followed joyfully and exclaimed
Well! well! (sâdhu), in confirmation of the true words (he spoke);

416. The Nâgas and the company of Devas acquired a condition of heart difficult to obtain, and
each with his own inherent light led on the way shedding forth their brightness.

417. Thus man and horse both strong of heart went onwards, lost to sight, like streaming stars,
but ere the eastern quarter flashed with light, they had advanced three yoganas.
