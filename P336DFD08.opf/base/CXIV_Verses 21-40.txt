Some doomed to die for the sake of skin or flesh, some for their horns or hair or bones or wings,1127.
Others torn or killed in mutual conflict, friend or relative before, contending
thus;

(some) burthened with loads or dragging heavy weights, (others) pierced and urged on by pricking
goads,1128. Blood flowing down their tortured forms, parched and hungry--no relief afforded;

then, turning round, (he saw) one with the other struggling, possessed of no independent strength;1129.
Flying through air or sunk in deep water, yet no place as a refuge left from death.

He saw, moreover, those, misers and covetous, born now as hungry ghosts,1130. Vast bodies like
the towering mountain, with mouths as small as any needle-tube, hungry and thirsty, nought
but fire and poison’d flame to enwrap their burning forms within.

1131. Covetous, they would not give to those who sought, or duped the man who gave in charity,
now born among the famished ghosts, they seek for food, but cannot find withal.1132. The
refuse of the unclean man they fain would eat,

but this is changed and lost (before it can be eaten); oh! if a man believes that covetousness
is thus repaid, as in their case,1133. Would he not give his very flesh in charity even
as Sivi râga did!

Then, once more (he saw), those reborn as men, with bodies like some foul sewer,1134. Ever moving
’midst the direst sufferings, born from the womb to fear and trembling, with body tender,
touching anything its feelings painful, as if cut with knives;

1135. Whilst born in this condition, no moment free from chance of death, labour, and sorrow,
yet seeking birth again, and being born again, enduring pain.
