657. And now the royal teacher (Purohita), an illustrious sage, with the chief minister, famed
for wisdom, with earnest and considerate minds, both exhorted with remonstrances, the king.

658. ’Pray you (they said) arouse yourself to thought, and let not grief cramp and hold your
mind! in olden days there were mighty kings, who left their country, as flowers are scattered;

659. ’Your son now practises the way of wisdom; why then nurse (increase) your grief and misery;
you should recall the prophecy of Asita, and reasonably count on what was probable!

660. ’(Think of) the heavenly joys which you, a universal king, have inherited! But now, so
troubled and constrained in mind, how will it not be said, "The Lord of earth can change his
golden-jewel-heart!"

661. ’Now, therefore, send us forth, arid bid us seek the place he occupies, then by some stratagem
and strong remonstrances, and showing him our earnestness of purpose,662. ’We will
break down his resolution, and thus assuage your kingly sorrow.’

The king, with joy, replied and said: ’Would that you both would go in haste,663. ’As swiftly
as the Saketa bird flies through the void for her young’s sake; thinking of nought but the
royal prince, and sad at heart--I shall await your search!’

664. The two men having received their orders, the king retired among his kinsfolk, his heart
somewhat more tranquillised, and breathing freely through his throat.
